# Spotify to Songwhip

## What it does

When you go to a URL that begins with `open.spotify.com/artist/` or `open.spotify.com/track/` you will be redirected to the Songwhip.com results page. For listeners who want to switch to Tidal, Qobuz, Apple Music, etc. without losing the social aspect of sharing Spotify links.
